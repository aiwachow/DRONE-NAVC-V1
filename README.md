# NAVIGATION CONTROL SYSTEM - TEST BOARD 
STM32 based flight controller for unmanned drone aircraft. <br />
Pcb has been manufactured and tested. However this design isn't perfect. <br />
It's just a demo for educational purposes. <br />


## Board

## Visualization 
I also made some basic 3D visualization in Python, in the future in QT. Mcu communicates with pc via bluetooth.
